    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      Problem: The Get Green app has issues engaging users to make long-term
      sustainable habits. Goal: Design a system of friendly UI features and
      personalized goal setting to ensure long-term engagement.

    <h3>Process Overview</h3>

    <p><b>Problem Definition:</b></p>
    <p>
      Through talking to GetGreens we explored their interest in directions to
      grow the app and related deliverables for our team. We reestablished the
      problem definition with GetGreen between each of the following sections.
    </p>
    <p><b>Exploring the problem:</b></p>
    <p>
      My group sought to understand long term pain points with a diary study,
      while searching for short term pain points with a participatory design
      session. Additionally we used a survey to search for outling issues we
      might of missed.
    </p>
    <p><b>Design:</b></p>
    <p>
      The team and I synthesized the data from our user research, ideated
      through solutions grading them on feasability and cohesion, then
      wireframed a serries of potential solutions.
    </p>
    <p><b>Evaluation:</b></p>
    <p>
      We validated our solutions by running usability tests on lofi prototypes.
      Once validated we created high fi prototypes and design assets for Get
      Green to integrate.
    </p>
    <h2>Exploring the Problem Space</h2><p>
      Preliminary Work / Exploring the Problem Mention affordance of time, and
      GetGreens willingness to send beta versions of the app to usability study
      participants. GetGreen is a sustainability habit building app that's
      looking to increase user retention through task recommendations and
      eco-friendly goals. Due to an abundance of time and high engagement with
      GetGreen our team was able to deeply dive into the problem space. Over two
      weeks our team set up a multiple week diary study, a survey of additional
      users, and a focused three-person participatory design session.
    </p>
    <!-- !!! Add second persona here when ready to experiment with tables -->
    <figure class="flex flex-col items-center">
      <Image
        src={Persona}
        alt="Persona of an amalgamated user of the GetGreen app."
        width="500"
        class=""
      />
      <figcaption>This persona shows...</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      We then synthesized the data we collected through affinity mapping, and
      created user personas based off of the participatory design and surveys.
      Once the data from the diary studies came back we were able to create
      accurate journey maps.

        class="popout"
      />
      <figcaption>This journey map shows...</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      From the data we collected we offered the following advice to GetGreen.
      <ol>
        <li>
          Smooth out information presentation in the app, by reducing first
          login questions and adding more repeatable habit-forming
          functionalities for longevity.
        </li>
        <li>Redesign how users add, track and manage action items</li>
        <li>
          Increase personalization of the app through unique settings and goals.
        </li>
      </ol>

      After discussions with GetGreen, we prioritized the following design
      spaces and began wireframing solutions: <ol>
        <li>App navigation & onboarding</li><li>Action item redesign</li><li>
          Personalization Settings
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Design & Redesign</h2>
    <p>
      To understand how we might create such features we ideated through several
      ideas. Once we had solutions to each problem, we used wireframes to see
      how we could combine them into a cohesive system that would continually
      keep users engaged. These wireframes captured big picture ideas such as
      content layout, features, and navigation of the Get Green app.
    </p>
    <figure class="flex flex-col items-center">
      <Image
        src={Wireframe}
        alt="Wireframe of a homescreen page showing a draft layout of the Get Green app."
        class="max-w-[250px]"
      />
      <figcaption>This wireframe shows...</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Then we took our final design system and made low fidelity prototypes. We
      combined the lofi prototypes with user flow diagrams to show how users
      could go about adding and tracking action items as well as navigating
      throughout the different functionalities.

        alt="Collection of several low fidelity screenshots with arrows pointing from page to page."
        class="popout"
      />
      <figcaption>
        In terms of overall experience, our low fidelity designs averaged at 81
        out of 100 on the US Government's System Usability Scale.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
      Then we conducted a short usability test with select users with these mock
      designs. We had the participants complete four tasks while thinking out
      loud throughout the process. Then we graded our prototypes by the
      following metrics: number of critical errors, satisfaction rates, and our
      own observation of the users. This final round of user testing gave us
      feedback on small pain points and which user flows were more used that we
      were able to incorporate into our final mock up.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then recreated our designs into high fidelity wireframes incorporating
      the visual branding and UI elements of the GetGreen application. We
      completely redesigned the onboarding module which should lead to users
      with shorter initial sessions within the app followed closely by several
      more consistent sessions in the following days.
    </p>
    <!-- !!! Add second pic (goalactions) here when ready to experiment with tables -->
    <figure class="flex flex-col items-center">
      <Image src={GoalPage} alt="hello" width="300" />
      <figcaption></figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      We improved the interactivity of the 'action items' which reduce user
      frustration with the app, and allow for more flexibility when it comes to
      the user self monitoring.
    </p>
    <!-- !!! Add second pic (goalactions) here when ready to experiment with tables -->
    <figure class="flex flex-wrap items-start">
      <Image src={HomePage} alt="hello" width="300" class="m-1" />
      <Image src={HomewoGoal} alt="hello" width="300" class="m-1" />

      <figcaption></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Finally we increased the options available to users in their settings and
      on their homepage. This should help even out the time users initially
      spend with the app and increase long term engagement with a goal centric
      improvement model to build towards.

    <h2>Reflection</h2><p>
      Through this capstone I have learned a lot about user research and team
      coordination. Since my group started with several user research methods I
      learned the most about what to expect and plan for in research settings.
      Including how to advertise for such opportunities, what to look out for
      and how to better control who is accepted into the studies. If I could
      have gone back and changed anything it would have been these primary user
      research cases. While grouping them at the start of our plan allowed us to
      efficiently run multiple of them at the same time it severely limited the
      takeaways we could have gathered if we spaced them out and iterated our
      designs between them. However this is an easy lesson to apply going
      forward and in this one case it helped us to solidify our design space
      when our sponsors had a hard time narrowing it down. In the future, the
      new experience with user research skills will be imperative when designing
      for spaces, micro-cultures, and technologies I do not have first hand
      experience with.
